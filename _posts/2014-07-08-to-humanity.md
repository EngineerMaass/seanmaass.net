## Everyone gets Lost; But just because We Stumble, Lose Our Way, __Doesn't mean that We are lost forever__.



We are going to get knocked down (and a lot), the KEY = to have the Ability and the Desire to Pick Ourselves back up, and get back on that Horse == HOPE.

Through my limited but quality Experiences and Observations, I have concluded that We as Humans can do some things now SUPER, SUPER, LIGHTNING BOLT FAST, but is it really Worthwhile or in our Benefit? Look at Google Maps for example, or any Navigation service for that matter.  To reference John Charles Wester, whom I Randomly had the great pleasure to be a participant for one of his Speeches, he stated that We now have the means to pinpoint exact longitudes and latitudes of places and things, But Do We Really Know Where We Are Going?  With Technology and Apps, We have been in such a Mode to get things done Fast, that We are Losing Sight on What is Really Important and to be Frank what is Safe and Effective.

I have discovered it the hard way with Google Maps. I am a Googler, so I apologize Google, but You need Honest Feedback. Honesty = Key.

I was stuck in a Mode where I just loaded the address to where I was going into Google Maps, and Would Trust that Google Maps would get me to Where I wanted to Go. How very, very WRONG I was.  The Locations haven't been Accurate, it would always take me on a random route, the Places simply didn't Exist, etc.  What I have discovered to Work the Best for Myself (which doesn't equate to Anyone else, even if I may want it to ;) ), is that You should Learn where it is You are going before just Blindly following someone or something that may take You down a wrong path.

### What Sean Has Learned:

I Learn the Location of my Destination. I Learn the Various Routes to My Destination from My Current One.  I use more than One source of Information.  And I'm getting Old School here probably because my Advisor has been rubbing off on me, but I make sure to have a PHYSICAL Map with Me. Again, it is ALL about Redundancy and Multiple Sources.

__And I Still Get Lost__. We have to Remember that things are not always going to go Our Way. But I have __Peace__ knowing that if I get Lost it is because of things that I can't explain and I did the Very Best I could to Get Where I Wanted to Go. I didn't just blindly follow someone/something else.

__Just because We Stumble, Lose Our Way, Doesn't Mean that We are lost forever.__

I Hope Everyone Finds the Journeys and Destination they are Looking for.

Sincerely,

Sean David Maass

### Update
I created the above post what seems like a century ago. A lot has transpired since the first Inception and Manifestation of the above. To be frank I use Google Maps a little more/I Trust Google Maps more than I did previously; I don’t know if Google Maps has gotten better or if I have just have LEARNED when to use it and when not to (a key thing I have Learned is to really trust my Intuition = Self Awareness of the Mind + Heart + Body + Soul).  I still stand behind everything in the original post, I will say however that I have Learned to really Trust MYSELF.  I still attempt to get to where I want to Go just using MySelf and with as little outside influence as possible. It Starts with the Self, in your very own Mind. Once you master YourSelf and Your Mind, You can Truly Accomplish AnyThing You Desire. With this You can then really __Trust Others__, and that is when the __Magic__ happens.
